			Journler includes fully integrated video recording that allows anyone with a Mac attached 
			video camera to record high quality video entries. <a href="spokenword.html">Record audio</a>, 
			<a href="snapshot.html">take a snapshot</a>, and add video to your entries. Oh yeah.
			</p><p>
			The video recorder is super easy to use. Bring it up by choosing <strong>Record Video</strong> 
			from the <strong>Edit</strong> > <strong>Insert Audio/Video</strong> menu.
			Once the recorder loads it will automatically begin previewing. The recorder also provides volume feedback.
			The preview and volume feedback remain active during the recording session.
			</p><p>
			To get that session started, all you need to do is press the <strong>record</strong> button.
			When you press the <strong>stop</strong> button on the recorder, the video center switches into playback mode. 
			You have the option to review your entire recording, jumping from part to part or playing the entire entry. 
			</p><p>
			Click the <strong>insert</strong> button to add it to your entry if you are satisfied with the material.
			The recording is stored along with the entry and linked from within its contents.
			</p><p style="clear:both;">
			<em>Tip</em>: hold down the <strong>alt/option</strong> key when launching the video window 
			to keep the recorder visible no matter what application you are using.
			</p><p>
			<h3>A/V Formatting</h3>
			To produce the highest quality video at the smallest file size, the video center encodes your recording on the fly, 
			converting it to the iPod compatible H.264 320x240 format. Audio is encoded in the 128k AAC format. If you notice that a finished 
			recording has a low framerate or if the preview is too jumpy to be useful, try MPEG4.
			The text at the top right of the controller is actually a menu you can use to change the format.
			The video quality may improve markedly but the file size will also be larger.
