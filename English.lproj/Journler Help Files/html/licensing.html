			<p>
			When Journler 2.5 was released I introduced a distinction that I hoped would allow me to remain as close as possible to this promise.
			I wrote at the time that, as an indie developer I was doing my best to stay true to my original intentions but it was becoming more and more difficult.
			</p><p>
			It has continued this way. Generally speaking, downloads do not lead to donations, and when they do it is often the minimum. 
			In the past few months, Journler has become more and more popular but I have earned less and less money. I have come to accept 
			the inevitable fact that an approach to software development which sustains itself primarily by gift is difficult if not impossible to maintain.
			</p><p>
			The problems are frustrating and circular. As Journler became more popular, the support requirements became greater. I ended up spending more time supporting users
			than releasing updates. With fewer updates, less income came in. The result is that, paradoxically, Journler's recent popularity has led to fewer earnings.
			</p><p>
			It has been suggested that I solve my problems by hiring additional help. But in order to hire help I need Journler to produce more income.
			In order to increase my income I must release updates. In order to release those updates I need to hire help, which of course costs money. Quite the bind.
			</p><p>
			I remain committed to producing a great product with steady updates supported by timely customer service. Thousands of users from across the world
			have found in Journler a useful and dependable application. I aim to keep it that way. Not to mention the great improvements that I'm just itching
			to work on if I can only find the time. I want to see Journler grow just as much as you do.
			</p><p>
			To make sure this happens I have settled on the difficult decision of transforming Journler into a shareware application. 
			Beginning with 2.6, the unenforced distinction between personal and non-personal licenses will be eliminated.
			Instead, a single license will cost $34.95 with an evaluation period of 60 days. Student and bulk discounts will be offered.
			</p><p>
			If you have already purchased a license or donated, the cost of the 2.6 upgrade will vary depending upon the circumstances of your contribution.
			For anyone with a non-personal license, the 2.6 upgrade will be free. Users who donated for a personal use license will be required to make up
			the difference between their contribution and the current price of $24.95. For example, if you donated $10 then the 2.6 upgrade will cost $14.95.
			</p><p>
			This has been a difficult decision, but it is the right one. Software has become my business, and the only way I am able to continue offering quality products
			with regular updates and timely customer service is if I treat these products as any business does. Thanks for your support and understanding.
