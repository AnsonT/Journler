			The Journler Lexicon is an infinite depth digital representation of the term-document relationships in your journal.
			</p><p>
			Entries and text-based file attachments are all composed of individual words which often appear in more than one place. 
			The lexicon shows the connections between words and entries, allowing you to see the implicit relationships spun like a web through your documents.
			</p><p>
			<h3>The Lexicon Proper</h3>
			From the <strong>Window</strong> menu choose <strong>Lexicon</strong>. 
			It may take a moment to load the viewer, but when finished the Lexicon displays every word contained in your journal. 
			Select a term from the list and Journler locates every entry or text based attachment that includes it. 
			</p><p>
			When you select one of those documents, two things happen. First, the Lexicon loads the file and displays it, 
			highlighting the originally selected word. Second, the Lexicon parses the document and displays every term that occurs in it alone.
			Selecting a term in the new list highlights it in the document and again shows every entry or text based attachment in which it occurs.
			At this point you have returned to step one and may select another document.
			</p><p>
			With speed and grace you are now able to traverse the relationships between your documents established implicitly by the words which they contain.
			The Lexicon is a new perspective on your thoughts and media, 
			preferring linguistic and semantic affinities to temporal and organizational restrictions. Connections exist that you don't know about. Discover them.
			</p><p style="clear:both;">
			<h3>The Embedded Lexicon</h3>
			<img src="../graphics/embeddedlexicon.png" width="400" align="right" style="padding-left:10px; padding-bottom:10px;">
			The Lexicon can be cumbersome. A large journal contains thousands of unique terms, many of no significance. 
			Cut through the complexity and go straight to the connections. 
			</p><p>
			Select any text based document in your journal, including entries, PDF, Word and text files as well as Mail messages and web pages or web archives.
			Highlight a single word in the text and right click (or hold down the <strong>ctrl</strong> key, clicking once).
			At the bottom of the context menu you will find the <strong>All Documents with Term</strong> submenu. Selecting it reveals every document which
			contains the highlighted term
			</p><p>
			When you chose a document from the list, Journler jumps to that entry or resource and highlights occurrences of the term you had originally selected.
			If the document is not what you were looking for, use the <strong>Back</strong> toolbar button at the top left of the window.
			The embedded lexicon respects <a href="modifiers.html">keyboard modifiers</a>, so that for example selecting a document from the list with the 
			<strong>command</strong> key down opens the document in a new tab instead of the current one.
			</p>

			<h3>Stop Words</h3>
			As your journal grows the lexicon will begin to contain terms that are of no use to you. 
			Some of these terms are common words such as prepositions and articles while others are junk that the search technology has picked up.
			You can filter these terms so that the lexicon and search engine both ignore them. 
			Select a range of words in one of the lexicon's columns and from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu choose <strong>Copy</strong>. 
			Click once on the <strong>Stop Words</strong> toolbar button at the top left of the window and <strong>Paste</strong> 
			the terms into the already existing list. Save your changes. Next time you use the lexicon Journler ignores the newly added terms.
			</p><p>
			A number of words are included by default in the stop list.
