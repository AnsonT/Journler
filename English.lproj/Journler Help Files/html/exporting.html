			Journler is an excellent way to store and keep track of your writings and media, but you'll want to use them outside of the program sometime.
			Blogging allows you to post your entries to the internet and is covered in <a href="blogging.html">Blogging</a>. Printing and file exporting are covered here.
			<p>
			<h3>Saving Entries as Independent Files</h3>
			Exporting saves your entry as an external file.  Journler supports seven file types to meet your needs: 
			text (txt), rich text (rtf) and rich text with attachments (rtfd), microsoft document (doc), 
			portable document format (pdf), hypertext web (xhtml) and web archive (webarchive).
			When you save your entry as a text, rich text, word, xhtml or web archive file Journler only exports the entry's text.
			Select the rtfd or pdf format to include embedded pictures in your exported entries. 
			</p><p>
			<img src="../graphics/files.png">
			</p><p>
			Choose <strong>Export Selected Entries</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu or use the 
			<strong>Export</strong> toolbar button to export the selected notes. 
			Alternatively choose <strong>Export Journal</strong> and export any dated range of entries from your entire journal.
			</p><p>
			<em>Tip:</em> Quickly save the selected entries as rich text documents by dragging them from the 
			<a href="basics.html#BrowsingEntries">Browse Table</a> to a folder in the Finder.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Saving Media as Independent Files</h3>
			You've attached a number of <a href="resources.html">files and other media</a> to your entries. Getting them out of your journal is easy.
			Select the media to display it in the built-in <a href="inlinemedia.html">media viewer</a> and from there choose 
			<strong>Export Selected Resources</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu. You may bypass this entire process and avoid
			actually viewing the media before exporting it. Either drag the icon embedded in your entry's text to a location in the Finder 
			or do the same for the icon shown in the <a href="resources.html#ResourcePane">resource pane</a>.
			</p><p>
			<em>Tip:</em> It is not currently possible to export an entry with its associated resources. 
			However, an Apple Script has been created to do just that. Have a look at Journler's <a href="http://journler.com/community/forums/">online forum</a> for more information.

			<h3><img src="../graphics/toolbarprint.png" align="absmiddle" style="margin-right:10px;">Printing Entries &amp; Media</h3>
			To create hard copies of your entries and media you will need to print them. Printing functions as it would in any word 
			processing program.  Specify your page settings in <strong>Page Setup</strong> under the <strong>File</strong> menu. 
			Choose an entry or attached file and press the <strong>Print</strong> toolbar button. 
			Make further changes to your print preferences, preview the print job, and set it going.
			</p><p>
			You can also print multiple entries in one session. Select <strong>Print Journal</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu. Just as 
			you would with the Journler export function, select a range of entries you would like to print. Journler will then build a single print job 
			from all of these entries. Be patient, especially if you are printing a number of entries. When the Print window appears, proceed as normal.
			</p><p>

			<h3>Print Customization</h3>
			Before you send your entries to the printer, take the opportunity to customize the print job. From the <strong>File</strong> menu 
			select <strong>Page Setup</strong>. Choose <strong>Journler</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> list. 
			</p><p>
			Journler Page Setup options are straightforward and can be checked in any combination. 
			Let's take page headers and footers as an example. 
			The header includes the title of the entry and the print date while the footer shows the page number and total number of pages.
