			With the click of a mouse Journler can export as many entries as you want to your Notes capable iPod. 
			Make sure your iPod is plugged in and has <strong>disk mode</strong> enabled. You'll know it does if the iPod appears
			on your desktop and contains the Calendars, Contacts and Notes folders. If your iPod does not appear on your desktop, 
			check the <strong>iPod preferences</strong> in <strong>iTunes</strong> and make sure <strong>Enable disk use</strong> 
			is checked at the bottom.
			<p>
			With your iPod connected click the <strong>Notes</strong> toolbar icon or select <strong>Export to iPod</strong> from the 
			<strong>File</strong> menu. Journler exports all of the entries currently selected in the 
			<a href="basics.html#BrowsingEntries">browse table</a>, sizing them into
			iPod friendly documents and connecting the pieces. Journler even translates your entry links into iPod links so that connections 
			remain active when you're on the go. Linked media does not remain linked in the iPod note.
