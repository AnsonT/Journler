			<h3>Entry Font</h3>
			The default font for new entries. Changing the entry font does not affect previously created entries.
			<p>
			<h3>Text Highlight</h3>
			Although the titels are fixed you may customze the colors used.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Linked Text</h3>
			Decide how Journler displays the linked text in your entries. 
			Links are used <a href="connecting.html">when referring to</a> other entries, files, media or webpages.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Show Word Count</h3>
			Include a live update word count at the bottom of the entry. 
			Live word count may slow Journler down when editing longer entries. 
			You may always choose <em>Word Count</em> from the <em>Edit > Utilities</em> menu. 
			Additionally, word count is not computed when the footer is hidden.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Use Smart Quotes</h3>
			Automatically replace regular quotes with curly quotes as you type.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Automatically Recognize URLs</h3>
			Text that begins with http:// is recognized as a url and turned into a web link after typing a space or return.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Automatically Recognize Wiki Links</h3>
			A wiki title is the title of an entry with the first letter of each word capitalized and no spaces between the words.
			For example, the wiki title for an entry named "My first day" is "MyFirstDay" while the title for "green roses" is "GreenRoses."
			An entry title must be composed of at least two words and not begin with punctuation in order for it to work as a wiki title.
			When you type a wiki title and press space or return, Journler recognizes the name and establishes a <a href="connecting.html">link to the entry</a>.
			Please note that currently Journler does not create an entry for a wiki title which does not already correspond to one.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Underline Misspelled Words</h3>
			Incorrectly spelled words are underlined in red.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Automatically Correct Misspelled Words</h3>
			Journler replaces incorrectly spelled words as you type.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Use Journler's Built-in Auto-correction</h3>
			Thorough auto-correction but potentially slower and more prone to errors.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Use a Word List</h3>
			The autocorrect word list uses a fixed database of word pairs to identify the correct spelling for a misspelled words. 
			It is fast and does not err, but it will not catch every mistake. You may modify the word list.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Set an Entry's Date Modified Only When Its Text Changes</h3>
			Journler updates the modification date whenever you change any of an entry's attributes, including the title, label or category. 
			Check this option to set the date modified only when you edit the actual, textual contents of an entry.
