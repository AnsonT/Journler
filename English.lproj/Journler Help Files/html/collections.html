			Folders change what it means for an entry to be an entry. With folders an entry is no longer a dated thought, a note attached to a 
			specific moment in time whose only means of access is that time. Folders make it possible for an entry to disconnect and 
			reconnect where needed, open it up to many points of access, some inherently belonging to the entry, others not.

			<h3><img src="../new_graphics/journler_icon_new.png" height="32" align="absmiddle" style="padding-right:10px;">The Journal</h3>
			The Journal is the root folder. It serves the same purpose as the library in iTunes or iPhoto. All your entries 
			are contained within the journal. When you need an overview of every entry you've written, select the <strong>Journal</strong> folder.
			When you choose a date in the calendar, Journler is implicity accessing the <strong>Journal</strong> as its source folder.
			</p><p>
			<h3><img src="../graphics/foldertrash.tif" align="absmiddle" style="padding-right:10px;">The Trash</h3>
			Entries you have deleted are first moved to the trash to prevent accidental data loss. Pressing the 
			<strong>delete</strong> key while holding down <strong>command</strong> (⌘) when an entry is selected in 
			the browse table will move it to the trash.
			</p><p>
			<h3><img src="../graphics/collectionnormal.png" align="absmiddle" style="padding-right:10px;">Regular Folders</h3>
			Regular folders allow you to group entries any way you want. When you place an entry in a folder 
			the entry is not <em>moved</em> to that folder but rather <em>added</em> to it, permitting you to place an entry in as many folders as you like.
			Create a regular folder with the <strong>worktool</strong> button 
			at the bottom  of the <strong>Folders</strong> list. Select <strong>New Folder</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Folders are empty when first created. Add entries to a folder by dragging them from the 
			<a href="basics.html#BrowsingEntries">Browse Table</a>. Click and hold down the mouse on the entry and  
			move it on top of the desired folder. Journler highlights the folder and the cursor shows a green circle with a plus in it, 
			indicating that you may add the entry to the folder.
			</p><p>
			When you need to remove an entry from a folder, select the appropriate folder and then the entry itself in the 
			<a href="basics.html#BrowsingEntries">Browse Table</a>. Press the <strong>delete</strong> key. The entry will be removed from 
			the folder without deleting it from your journal or other folders. You may also drag the entry out of the folder just like you dragged it in.
			</p><p>
			A folder holds as many entries as you need in any combination you want. Folders allow you to view your entries from an angle 
			of your choosing, grouping them in ways that the entries themselves do not necessarily suggest. Because an entry can be added to more than one 
			folder, you are able to easily maintain and view complex relationships between an entry and the entries related to it.
