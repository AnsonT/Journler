			<h3>Tabbed Editing</h3>
			Tabs are the revolutionary way to access multiple documents with ease. Modern web browsers feature tabs so you can move between
			web pages without opening up duplicates of your web browser or even new windows. Journler features tabs so you can access more than
			one entry in the same space without ever losing your place.
			<p>
			<img src="../graphics/tabsexample.png">
			</p><p>
			The tab bar is always active even if you can't see it. It appears when you begin viewing multiple entries or at launch if you have 
			checked the appropriate option (see <a href="prefappearance.html">Appearance Preferences</a>). 
			</p><p>
			By default, when you select an entry in
			the <a href="basics.html#BrowsingEntries">Browse Table</a> or click on an internal link, Journler loads the new entry into the same tab. 
			When you want to open an entry in a new tab, hold down the <strong>control</strong> key (ctrl) 
			and click on the entry in the Browse Table. 
			Near the bottom of the menu you will see two items, <strong>Open in New Tab</strong> and <strong>Open in New Window</strong>. 
			</p><p>
			<em>Tip</em>: Bypass the context menu and use keyboard modifiers as you select an entry from the list to open it automatically in a new tab or window. <a href="modifiers.html">Read more</a>.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Opening a Linked Entry into a New Tab</h3>
			If you have linked to an entry from within another entry's text, 
			you can quickly open the link into its own tab. The shortcuts are the same as in Safari.
			<table width="" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" bgcolor=>
			  <tr align="">
				<td><img src="../graphics/keytab.png"></td>
				<td width="150">
					
					Hold down the command key to open an entry in a new tab.
					
				</td>
				<td><img src="../graphics/keytabselect.png"></td>
				<td width="240">
					
					Hold down the shift and command keys to open an entry in a new tab and simultaneously select it.
					
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
			</p><p>
			You can open up as many tabs as you need. Journler doesn't mind. If you run out of space in the tab bar, Journler creates a 
			tabs menu on the far right from which you can continue to access your entries. When you need to close a tab, 
			select <strong>Close Tab</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu or simply click the appropriate <strong>circle-x</strong>. 
			To move between tabs select the needed 
			tab or use <strong>Select Next Tab</strong> and <strong>Select Previous Tab</strong> in the <strong>View</strong> menu.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Separate Windows</h3>
			If tabs aren't you're thing edit your entries in a separate window instead. By default, when you create a new entry Journler 
			places it in the main content area. You can change this behavior in <a href="prefadvanced.html">Advanced Preferences</a>. 
			</p>

			<strong>Opening a Linked Entry into a New Window</strong>
			<table width="" border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5">
			  <tr align="">
				<td><img src="../graphics/keywindow.png"></td>
				<td width="">
				Hold down the command and option keys to open an entry in a new window. 
				The window will automatically come to the fore</td>
				
			  </tr>
			</table>
			</p><p>
			Like tabs, you may open as many windows as you need and Journler will handle their management. 
			To move between windows, use the list at the bottom of the <strong>Window</strong> menu. 
			Entry windows give you full access to all of Journler's features. You can customize their toolbars
			and operate on the entries in them using all of Journler's related menu items.
			</p><p>
			Tabs and windows are accessible with keyboard modifiers from almost anywhere you can select an entry or resource. <a href="modifiers.html">Read more</a>.
