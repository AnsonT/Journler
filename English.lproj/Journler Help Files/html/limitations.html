			Journler is not perfect. No program is. Journler will never meet all the needs of every person, and it shouldn't. 
			Bloatware is a thin line to walk, and I'm working hard to pack Journler full of features 
			while keeping the interface simple and the program slim. So you have a better idea of what Journler does, doesn't and wants to do, 
			here's an overview.
			</p><p>
			<h3>What Journler does</h3>
			Journler does a lot, and does it well. 
			The most important thing to keep in mind is that Journler places the written entry at the center. Journler handles media like a trooper,
			but Journler is even better at making it possible for you to <em>write</em> about that media.
			</p><p>
			<em>1. Journler is a journaling program</em><br>
			If Journler excels at one thing, it's journaling. Chronicle your life, organize and find the entries in your digital diary.
			</p><p>
			<em>2. Journler finds and connects</em><br>
			Most interesting to me. <a href="searchandfilter.html">Find</a> and <a href="connecting.html">bind</a> the entries and media in your journal, 
			<a href="lexicon.html">discover</a> implicit connections. Good stuff here.
			</p><p>
			<em>3. Journler does document management</em><br>
			Have a lot of documents? Journler keeps track of them. Watch out for Lex, Journler's upcoming document management brother.
			</p><p>
			<em>4. Journler does GTD</em><br>
			Journler's flexibility makes it a good GTD companion. With the right setup you'll be getting things done like crazy.
			</p><p>
			<em>5. Journler does project management</em><br>
			A powerful <a href="smartfolders.html">smart folder system</a> keeps things organized. 
			<a href="abintegration.html">Address Book integration</a> keeps you in touch. iCal integration is coming up.
			</p><p>
			<h3>What Journler is not</h3>
			It's also good to be clear about what Journler is not. You'll have a much more enjoyable journaling experience with the right expectations.
			</p><p>
			<em>1. Journler is not a (pro) blogging client</em><br>
			Pro bloggers, go with something else. Serious work is needed here. Amateur bloggers may feel right at home. Do keep an eye out.
			</p><p>
			<em>2. Journler is not a full featured text editor</em><br>
			Admittedly, it has some impresive features, and users are even dropping Word for Journler. But some things just aren't supported.
			</p><p>
			<em>3. Journler is not a place to store secure data</em><br>
			Journler does not support encryption. If your security needs are high, go with something else or use an encrypted disk image.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<h3>In the works</h3>
			There are a number of additional features that could really improve the program.
			The brainstorming's been going on for some time.
			In the meantime, don't be afraid to combine applications as you seek to establish the ideal working environment. 
			Check out Journler's competition, but keep in mind this smattering of upcoming features.
			</p><p>
			<em>1. Syncing</em><br>
			One of the most requested features. Journler is a <a href="datastorage.html">"single database"</a> application, 
			and it should be able to sync between computers.
			</p><p>
			<em>2. Bonjour</em><br>
			Share your journal over the network with other Journler users just like you share your music with iTunes.
			</p><p>
			<em>3. Blogging</em><br>
			Journler's <a href="blogging.html">blogging support</a> requires substantial work. 'Nuf said.
			</p><p>
			<em>4. Resource filtering</em><br>
			Smart folders do not act on attached media. They only work on the entry content itself. Would be very handy, but is quite difficult.
			</p><p>
			<em>5. iCal integration</em><br>
			Absolutely. Leopard will make it possible.
