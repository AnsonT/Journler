			With Journler's <strong>Information Panel</strong> it's easy to modify any of your entry's properties, 
			much like you can quickly edit an mp3 file using the iTunes Information window. Alter the title, category or tags of your entry 
			and add or remove blogs to manually keep track of which entries have been posted where. 
			</p><p>
			For example, if you send an entry to a blog using a third party application, you can use the information panel to let 
			Journler know that this entry has been blogged. 
			When you manually add a blog you must include three pieces of information. <strong>Type</strong> should be the kind of blog, 
			ie LiveJournal, Blogger, etc. <strong>Blog Name</strong> is the name you have given to your blog. 
			<strong>Journal</strong> varies between
			different blogging services, but should be the actual name of the journal, blog, or category to which the entry was posted.

			<h3>Editing Multiple Entries</h3>
			Journler's Info panel can also be used to edit the properties of many entries simultaneously. 
			Select more than one entry in the <a href="basics.html#BrowsingEntries">Browse Table</a> 
			and then choose <strong>Information</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu.
			</p><p>
			Editing multiple entries is similar to editing multiple tracks in iTunes. Make your changes to the desired fields.
			The checkbox to the left of a field will light up when you edit it. 
			This lets Journler know you want to update this property in all the 
			edited entries when you save your changes.
			</p><p>
			If you edit a field then change your mind, you can uncheck the box to prevent that 
			property from being altered. Once you have finished making your changes, click <strong>Save</strong> to update every 
			edited entry with the new values. The Date Modified property of each entry will also be updated.
