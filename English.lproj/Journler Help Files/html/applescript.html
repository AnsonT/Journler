			Journler's AppleScript support is robust, providing access to your entries, folders, media and blogs 
			as well as a number of user interface items. Third party scripters can use AppleScript to modify
			a journal internally or to pass its contents to other applications and processes.
			<p>
			<h3>The Scripts Menu</h3>
			The Journler download includes a set of default Apple Scripts. You must install them before they are accessible via the scripts menu 
			in the program's menu bar. To install the scripts create a <strong>Journler</strong> folder in your 
			<strong>Home folder &gt; Library &gt; Scripts</strong> and add them to it. You may need to create the Scripts folder if it is not already there.
			</p><p>
			You can add your own scripts to the menu. Fill it with any of your homebrewed scripts or those you have found online. 
			In fact, you can put any documents 
			or applications in this folder and have immediate access to them from within Journler via the scripts menu, 
			organized into the subfolders you have specified.
			</p><p>
			If you'd like to create a few scripts of your own but need some help getting started, have a look at what's included. 
			Open any of the example scripts in the Script Editor application by holding down the <strong>alt/option</strong> 
			key as you make your selection. Show the script in the Finder by hodling down the <strong>shift</strong> key instead.
			</p><p>
			<h3>The Customizable Media Bar</h3>
			Journler's built-in media viewer may be customized to run Apple Scripts on the selected media. 
			This is a powerful feature that allows you to initiate a custom workflow on any media in your journal.

			</p><p>
			<h3>Getting Help</h3>
			The first place to look for information on scripting Journler is Journler's scripting dictionary.
			Launch the <strong>Script Editor</strong> application and add Journler to the <strong>Library</strong>. From here you have 
			complete access to the objects, commands and enumerations supported by Journler.
			</p><p>
			The <a href="http://journler.com/features/applescript/">AppleScript page</a> at journler.com includes a comprehensive set of examples that 
			cover just about everything you can do with Apple Script and Journler. Finally, you'll find more help on scripting Journler 
			at the <a href="http://journler.com/community/forums/viewforum.php?f=9">AppleScript and Automator forum</a>. 
			For master scripters it's a place to share your creations with the Journler community and exchange ideas.
			</p><p>
			<h3>Collecting entries and adding them to the search index</h3>
			Anticipating that an Apple Script may create dozens or even hundreds of entries in a matter of minutes, 
			Journler delays adding a script modified entry to its search index and relevant smart folders. 
			When you have finished creating or changing a batch of entries, 
			call the <font color="blue"><em>save changes</em></font> command at the application level to update your smart folders and search index.
