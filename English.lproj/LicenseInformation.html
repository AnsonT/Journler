<h3>The Journler License v2.5.4</h3>
</p><p>
Journler is in the process of becoming a shareware application.
Previous versions of Journler granted unlimited personal use while requesting 
a minimum donation of $10, or non-personal use for an unenforced $24.95 registration.
</p><p>
Future versions of Journler will cost $34.95, beginning with the next major upgrade.
The personal and non-personal distinction will be eliminated. 
There will be a single license at a standard price. The trial period will last 60 days. 
Student and bulk rebates will be offered.
</p><p>
In order to facilitate the transition from donation-ware to shareware, 
this version of Journler does not distinguish between the personal and non-personal use licenses.
A single registration costs $34.95. However, registration will remain non-compulsory until version 2.6 is released.
</p><p>
If you use Journler consistently and have not yet contributed but plan to do so once 2.6 comes out, 
please consider making that $34.95 contribution early. Version 2.6 is a free upgrade for all users
who register now.
