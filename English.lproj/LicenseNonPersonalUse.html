<H3>The Journler license is changing</H3>
Journler is in the process of becoming a shareware application.
Previous versions of Journler granted unlimited non-personal use while requesting 
an unenforced purchase of $24.95.
</p><p>
Future versions of Journler will cost $34.95, beginning with the next major upgrade.
The personal and non-personal distinction will be eliminated. 
There will be a single license at a standard price. The trial period will last 60 days. 
Student and bulk rebates will be offered.
</p><p>
Because you are already a fully registered user, there will be no charge for the 2.6 upgrade.
</p><p>
This has been a difficult decision, but it is the right one. 
Software has become my business, and the only way I am able to continue offering quality products
with regular updates and timely customer service is if I treat these products as any business does.
Thanks for your support and understanding.</p>
